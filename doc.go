/*
	Package stopwatch implements a two button stopwatch.

	A stopwatch is a handheld timepiece designed to measure
	the amount of time elapsed from a particular time when
	it is activated to the time when the piece is deactivated.

	The timing functions are traditionally
	controlled by two buttons on the case.

	Pressing the top button starts the timer running,
	and pressing the button a second time stops it,
	leaving the elapsed time displayed.

	A press of the second button then resets
	the stopwatch to zero. The second button is also
	used to record split times or lap times.
	When the split time button is pressed while
	the watch is running, the display freezes,
	allowing the elapsed time to that point to be read,
	but the watch mechanism continues running to record
	total elapsed time. Pressing the split button
	a second time allows the watch to resume
	display of total time.
